## Original code
#number = int(input())
#
#if number % 2 = 0:
#    print("This is an even number")
#else:
#    print("This is an odd number")

##Fixed code. Equality operator is '=='
number = int(input())

if number % 2 == 0:
   print("This is an even number")
else:
   print("This is an odd number")
